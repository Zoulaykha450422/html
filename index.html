Technical Documentation: Smart Budget Tracker System
Architecture Overview:
1. HTML defines the structure of the application and provides the interface components like forms and lists.
2. CSS ensures a responsive and visually appealing design.
3. JavaScript implements the business logic, including expense management and dynamic DOM updates.
