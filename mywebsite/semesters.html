        <p class="par4">Fist Semester: I started my first semester at CSCC on Autaumn 2021. I had a great and an easy semester. 
            I took three classes for that semester which are Cols class, ESL English 190, and Math 1099.
            All my Professors were really nice, and they helped me a lot troughout the semester.<br><br>
            Second Semester: As for my second semester, Spring 2022, it was also a smooth semester. I started taking my major classes.
            I took two of my major classes which were Data Bases Fundamental, and Intro to Computer Science Math.
            I also started English 1100. I had a great semester and was able pass all my classes with a 4.0 GPA.<br><br>
            Third Semester: For my third semester, Autumn 2022, this where things started to be more challenging 
            because I was taking four classes, and all classes were a little difficult. I was taking a History class, a Biology class,
            and IT Fundamental class. All my major class were good, but I was struggling with the Anatomy and the History classes.
            I barely passed those classes. For me it was a little tough, but I made it through the end.<br><br>
            Four Semester: This semester was on spring 2023. I started with Four classes but I dropped one class 
            after the first week of school because I was not understanding the content, and the explanation the teacher were giving.
            I continue on with Computer Concept & Application, Intro to Programming Logic, and with Networking Concept and Application.
            There were a lot of work, but I maneged it and were able to pass all class with high marks.<br><br>
            Fifth Semester: This semester was last Summer semester 2023. I was my first time taking classes during the summer.
            I took two classes which was Sociology and Business Agile Dev. I was afraid because people say that it will be a hard semester 
            because of the short time period, but it was a great semester, and passed both classes with a 4.0 GPA.<br><br>
            Sixth Semester: This Autumn semester 2023 is much more challenging because I am taking five classes with a lot of contents.
            I am struggling a lot with turning on assigment on time because I have at least 10 assigments to submit by week,
            and I am working full time. I hope to pass all my classes by the end of the semester so that I will be able to graduate next semester.
