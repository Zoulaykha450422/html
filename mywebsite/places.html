        <p class="par5">I Haven't been to so many places, but I visited Michigan a couple of times.
            I also have been to New Jersey last summer for 10 days. But I was in New York everyday. While being there, I have visited so many places,
            and I had a great time. I went to Times Square, and to restaurants. I Visited Houdson Yard, Little Island, Central Park, 
            Nine Eleven Memorial, Brooklyn Bridge. I had a great time. If you want to know how is it like before you visit Times Square, the <a href="https://www.timessquarenyc.org/">Times Square</a>
            website is a great site to visit because it shows all the events that hapens by day and night and it have nice pictures on the site that really shows the beauty of the city.<br><br>
            I visited Michigan like five to six times because my older brother live there. Whenever I go there, I always go out to try some food
            because the only thing nice about Michigan is the food. If you live in Michican or ever went there to visit, you definitely should visit the <a href="https://secretdetroit.co/indian-restaurants-detroit/">Secret Detroit</a>
            wesite, which countain the ten (10) best Indian restaurants around the town. I have being to a lot of restaurants with so many different food. 
            My brother also take me to Museum and other places like the Bridge.<br><br>
            I have eights pictures below, which each picture 
            represente the memories of each place I have visited. In case of any advice or quetions about any of these places, please feel free to contact me.
