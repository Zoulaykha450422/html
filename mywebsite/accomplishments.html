        <p class="par6">Eventhough I am not done with my studies yet, but I can say that I had accomplished a lot of things in life. Like I mentioned before in the 
            <a href="about.html" target="_blank">About</a> page, I came here five years ago from West Africa, and finish High school and graduated within two years.
            I started my college jurney at <a href="https://www.cscc.edu/">CSCC</a>, and I can say that I am half through done. I am so proud of the young woman I have became. 
            I would not thing that I will get where I am rigth now if I was asked five years ago when I just came here. 
            It was not always easy because I did not know anything and I couldn't speak English. I learned a lot from my High school teachers,
            my college teachers, and from people and collegue at work. I am so happy, and gratefful for who I became
            and for what I have accomplished. After my associate degree at Columbus State Community College, I would love to pursuit my studies further more at the Ohio State University. 
            I have already started looking the <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">OSU</a> website for the different types of programmes they offers.
